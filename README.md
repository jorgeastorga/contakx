# GoWebapp
A simple project to learn how to write web applications in Go and also learn Go along the way.


## Getting started with the project
1. Install Go
2. Setup your Go Workspace (e.g. setup $GOPATH)
3. Run: go get github.com/jorgeastorga/gowebapp
4. Run: gowebapp

Note: I won't go into the details of steps #1 and #2 as those are platform-dependent and can be explained elsewhere in more detail.
